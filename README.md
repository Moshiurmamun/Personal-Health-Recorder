# Personal-Health-Recorder
My Final Year Project 

The project paper aims at improving health care service in our country. A Personal Health Recorder that will help us if we fall sick at any time and need to buy medicines instantly. The system allows if we are outside of home, we will know what medicines we need exactly. People can incidentally lose their medical reports. So, user stores the information of all diseases and perspective prescriptions and a short details of his/her disease sorted by date and time in the system. Each time a user takes treatment then the respective prescription and other related information is stored in the database by doctor. Later, if a user logs in he can view his/her entire medical history whenever needed. At the same time, a doctor may view patient’s medical history. Long appointment waiting time can have a negative impact on patient. This project is an online doctor appointment booking system that provides patients an easy way of booking a doctor’s appointment online. This system manages to certified doctors all over the country and users can easily appointment with the doctor in real time. This allows an automated patient-doctor handling system through an online interface.
